# Dog Breed Image Classification Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify dog images into different breeds, by using a data set that consists of 8351 images classified into 133 breeds. This project is not driven by practical needs, but is motivated by learning to apply state of the art machine learning techniques to image classification. In particular, I am motivated to compare the classifier performance with versus without applying transfer learning techniques.

It includes two components
* A Jupyter notebook where image classification models are trained and evaluated.
* A project report that summarized project findings.
